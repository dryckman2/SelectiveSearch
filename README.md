# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Recommended Startup Scripts

## In server directory

### Run `npm install` on server to install dependencies

### Run `npm start` to begin backend server

Server should report that it started on port 3002

Server will then prompt for commands. Only current command is `exit` which will disconnect the server and close the connection.

After `exit`, hit Ctrl+C to close javascript

## In a second terminal, open the base directory

### Run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies

### Run `npm start` to begin frontend server
